// PEER CODE REVIEW FOR BooTheDog.html //
// “Ln.” is abbreviation for the word “Line,” which will be followed by the respective line number in reference. //
    1. Ln. 1: It’s a good practice to have a closing tag, even if the HTML tag self-closes.
    2. Ln. 2: This line should read <html lang="en”>, in order to be up to standard of HTML 5.

// Concerning the <head></head> tag area //
    1. Ln. 3 to 13: It is advisable to indent the <head></head> and <body></body> tags, once, since they are under the <html lang="en"></html> tag.
    2. Ln. 4: should have read (in keeping with the industry standard) under the <head></head>, <meta charset="UTF-8">
    3. Ln. 5: should have read (in keeping with the industry standard) <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    4. Ln. 12: advise to double quote the href source, in the <link href… />; i. e. <link href=“https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat|Roboto+Slab|Yellowtail” rel=“stylesheet” type=“text/css” />

// Concerning the <body></body> tag area //
    1. Ln. 16 to 111: Proper indention is needed between lines 16 to 111.  If you close each relative tag, within the <body></body> tag, you will be able to see which tags need indenting, easier.  Most are off by one indention. Improper indention could yield improper code.
    2. Ln. 19: Suggest using a header tag; i. e. <h1>Boo The Dog Fan Page!</h1>
    3. Ln. 22: <div class="row"> needs to be indented to the left: it is parent to <div class="col-sm-12”>; which is the parent <div class="panel panel-primary", whose child is <div class="panel-heading">Instructions</div>, whose cold is <div class="panel-body text-center”>.  Once these are indented, properly, most IDE’s can show you their closing tags (if one was made/needs to be made).
    4. Ln. 27 to 29: Advised to use <p></p> verses <h4></4> tags.
    5. Ln. 35 to 39: Improper indention.  <div class="row"> is parent to <div class="col-sm-6”>, whom is parent to <div class="panel panel-primary”>, whom is parent to <div class="panel-heading">About Boo</div>, whom is parent to <div class="panel-body”>.
    6. Ln. 40 to 42: Each line should have a <p></p> tag; and be under the <div class="panel-body”></div>.
    7. Ln. 44 to 46: These are the closing tags to Ln. 35-39; and should be properly indented, respectively.
    8. Ln. 47 to 54: Improper indention of <div class="col-sm-6"></div> and the child <div></div> tags within this <div></div> tag.
    9. Ln. 55 to 56: Personal preference to ensuring clean code: separate the <br> tags by line; but this self-closing tag will work; but it makes things easier to read/follow the idea/thought.
    10. Ln. 58 to 66: Improper indention of <div class="col-sm-6"></div> and the child <div></div> tags within this <div></div> tag.
    11. Ln. 67 to 81: Improper indention of <div class="col-sm-6"></div> and the child <div></div> tags within this <div></div> tag.
    12. Ln. 83: Personal preference to ensuring clean code: separate the <br> tags by line; but this self-closing tag will work; but it makes things easier to read/follow the idea/thought.
    13. L.n 85 to 97:  Improper indention of <div class="row text-center"> and the child <div></div> tags within this <div></div> tag.
    14. L.n 99 to 111:  Improper indention of <div class="col-sm-6"> and the child <div></div> tags within this <div></div> tag.
    15. Ln. 114 to 115: don’t to properly indent these closing tags to Ln. 2 and Ln. 14.
